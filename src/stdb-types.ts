// Row suffix type aliases for namespace disambiguation.
// v2 codegen exports bare PascalCase types (e.g. Character, Location, Group) which
// can collide with browser globals or generic names. XxxRow aliases (e.g. CharacterRow,
// LocationRow) make DB row types unambiguous throughout client code.
