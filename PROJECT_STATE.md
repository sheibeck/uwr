# Project State (Unwritten Realms)

Last updated: 2026-02-09

## Overview
- Text-based MMORPG using SpacetimeDB (TypeScript server) + Vue 3 client.
- Local/standalone SpacetimeDB (no maincloud).
- Core loop: create character, move between locations, submit commands, combat, event log.
- Event streams are segmented: world, location, private, group.

## Architecture
- Server: `C:\projects\uwr\spacetimedb\src\index.ts` (schema + helpers) and `C:\projects\uwr\spacetimedb\src\reducers\` (feature reducers).
- Client: Vue 3 app with composables and UI components.
- Bindings: generated via `spacetime generate` into `C:\projects\uwr\src\module_bindings`.
- Styles: inline style objects in `src/ui/styles.ts`.

## Key Features Implemented
- **Auth (MVP):** Email login without verification.
  - Reducers: `login_email`, `logout`.
  - Player has `userId` (u64) + `sessionStartedAt`.
  - UI shows logged-in email and logout.
- **Session-only logs:** Client filters events by `player.sessionStartedAt`.
- **Presence:** Only friends see online/offline; only when a character becomes active.
- **Commands:**
  - `/look`: private location description.
  - `/say`: location chat.
  - `/w` / `/whisper`: private whisper (purple).
  - `/hail <npc>` or `Hail, <NPC Name>`: speak to an NPC in your current location.
  - `/invite`, `/accept`, `/decline` for groups.
  - `/kick`, `/promote`, `/leave`.
  - `/friend <character>` sends friend request.
- **Groups:**
  - Invite-only; auto-create group on invite.
  - Leader can invite, kick, promote.
  - Leader movement pulls members who opted into follow and are in same location.
  - Follow leader toggle (default ON); hidden for leaders.
  - Group disband when last member leaves; leader auto-promoted when leader leaves.
  - Pending invite UI in Group panel.
  - Group and combat member lists show the current player first.
- **Friends:**
  - Mutual friends + friend requests.
  - Friends panel shows incoming and outgoing requests.
  - `/friend` sends request; duplicates show message.
- **Combat (MVP):**
  - Location-based enemy spawns; one enemy per group/solo.
  - Leader-only engages for groups; solo engages for self.
  - **Realtime loop**: `combat_loop` reducer runs every 1s via `combat_loop_tick`.
  - Combat loop timing: `COMBAT_LOOP_INTERVAL_MICROS = 1_000_000` (1s).
  - Combat cleanup now guards loop tick handles defensively to avoid missing-table crashes after schema changes.
- Auto-attacks every 5s using equipped weapon; auto-attacks pause while casting.
  - Abilities execute immediately or after cast time; auto-attacks pause while casting.
  - Casting is unified server-side via `character_cast` + `cast_tick` (200ms).
  - Aggro from damage only.
  - Combat auto-opens for all group members.
  - Dead characters cannot act; combat ends if all active participants are dead.
  - Dead characters revive at 1/4 HP/Mana/Stamina after combat ends.
  - Enemy respawns after death; new spawns created as new groups/solos arrive.
  - Combat results screen shown after combat; leader dismisses to return to enemy list.
  - XP on victory with level-up support (cap 10). XP split among non-dead participants.
  - Movement is blocked while in combat (cannot travel during combat).
  - Effect durations are driven only by effect tick loops (HoT/DoT at 3s, others at 10s) and do not decrement on combat ticks.
  - Enemy DoTs tick and log damage every 3s.
- **Characters:**
  - Max 3 character slots per account (MVP).
  - Character deletion with confirmation + full cleanup.
  - Non-mana classes now have `maxMana = 0` and UI hides mana bars.
  - Characters have `boundLocationId` and respawn there on death (1 HP + 1 mana/stamina if applicable).
- **Questing (MVP):**
  - NPCs live in towns/cities and show up in the NPC accordion.
  - Hail/click to receive NPC dialog lines stored in a dedicated NPC dialog log.
  - NPCs can offer kill quests within level range; quest progress tracks per character.
  - Journal panel shows NPC dialog history and quest progress.
- **Regen:**
  - HP/Mana/Stamina regen every 8s.
  - Out of combat: full rate. In combat: half rate (every other tick).
  - No regen while dead; revive after combat at 1/4 of max HP/Mana/Stamina.
- **Regions/Locations:**
  - Regions now include `regionType` (`outdoor`, `indoor`, `dungeon`) for future buffs/events.
  - Current regions are `outdoor`.
  - Abilities can later scale up/down based on `regionType`, `terrainType`, or day/night state.

- Dead participants receive 50% XP.
- Death penalty (level > 5): lose 5% of current level progress, never lose a level.
- Level-up applies class stat growth and unlocks new class abilities.
## UI State (Current)
- **Layout:**
  - Centered log window; floating windows around it.
  - Floating windows are draggable and persist positions in localStorage.
  - Group panel is always visible (floating, compact width).
  - Region/Locations + Inhabitants are combined into one floating panel on the right.
  - Action bar panels open as floating windows (closable with X).
  - Travel and Combat buttons removed from action bar.
  - Hotbar is a vertical, draggable floating dock left of the log; always visible with 10 slots.
- **Log:**
  - Command input with `/` autocomplete and keyboard navigation.
  - Session-only logs (filter by `player.sessionStartedAt`).
- **Inhabitants Panel:**
  - Accordion sections: Characters, NPCs, Enemies.
  - Characters list moved from log to this panel.
  - Enemies section handles combat actions; enemy list is con-colored.
  - Active enemy shows HP bar, target, status, and effect badges (red = debuff, blue = buff).
  - During combat or result screens, the Location panel shows only the combat UI (full-height), hiding Travel/Characters/NPCs until dismiss.
  - Location header shows bindstone icon for bindable locations; click to bind.
- **Journal Panel:**
  - NPC dialog history and quest tracking (giver, location, progress).
- **Travel Mini-map:**
  - Shows current region in header, connected locations with arrows, region names, and target level con colors.
  - Region header now includes `L#` with con color, plus region/location type line in italics.
- **Hotbar:**
  - Configuration via Hotbar panel; combat-use via vertical dock.
  - Hotbar shows cast fill + cooldown counters; highlights while casting.
  - Empty slots shown.

## Ability Plan (MVP, Lv1–Lv5)
- Rules:
  - Combat abilities at levels 1, 3, 5.
  - Non-combat abilities at levels 2, 4 (usable in or out of combat).
  - Spells use Mana; techniques use Stamina.
- Note: L1 ability keys now match their updated names (e.g., `rogue_shadow_cut`, `ranger_marked_shot`). These keys are stored in DB tables (hotbar slots, casts, cooldowns), so future renames require a migration strategy once data wipes are no longer acceptable.

## Client Structure
- Composables:
  - `useGameData`, `usePlayer`, `useAuth`, `useCharacters`, `useEvents`,
  - `useCharacterCreation`, `useCommands`, `useCombat`, `useGroups`, `useMovement`, `useFriends`.
- Components:
  - `AppHeader`, `LogWindow`, `PanelShell`, `CharacterPanel`, `InventoryPanel`,

## Styling
- Dark theme, inline styles in `src/ui/styles.ts`.

## Known Behaviors / Notes
- Character names are globally unique (case-insensitive).
- `/accept` or `/decline` without a name works if exactly one pending invite exists.
- Command autocomplete appears when input starts with `/`, supports keyboard navigation.
- Group invite alerts invitee via private event.
- Friend request success/failure messages emitted via private events.
- Event tables (`event_world`, `event_location`, `event_private`, `event_group`) are trimmed on write to last 200 per scope and anything older than 1 hour.
- **Stamina/Mana migration pending:** schema changes require publishing with `--delete-data`.
- **Region/Location migration pending:** schema changes require publishing with `--delete-data`.
- **Item/Enemy schema expansion pending:** schema changes require publishing with `--delete-data`.

## Required Commands
- Publish local module: `spacetime publish uwr --project-path spacetimedb --server local`
- Publish with data deletion (for stamina/mana schema): `spacetime publish uwr --project-path spacetimedb --server local --delete-data`
- Generate bindings: `spacetime generate --lang typescript --out-dir src/module_bindings --project-path spacetimedb`
- Start local server: `spacetime start`
- Dev server: `npm run dev`

## Open Items / TODO
- Upgrade auth to email verification (magic link / OTP).
- Optional: add outgoing invite list in group UI.
- Optional: add friend request notifications in UI beyond log.
- TODO: Apply buff/debuff effects to combat calculations beyond AC (e.g., stats, hit/dodge/crit, damage).
