# Phase 3.1.1: Combat Balance Part 2 - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-12
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Balance DoT (damage over time), HoT (heal over time), and debuff/buff effects within the stat scaling system established in Phase 3.1. Extends the combat balance foundation to cover periodic effects, utility abilities, and multi-target scenarios.

Phase 3.1 established: STR auto-attack scaling, DEX crits, ability damage formulas (hybrid formula with stat scaling), WIS healing scaling, magic/physical damage routing, and tuned scaling constants.

Phase 3.1.1 addresses: How DoTs/HoTs/debuffs scale with stats, how they interact with power budgets, how they stack/refresh, and how AoE abilities are balanced.

## Implementation Decisions

### DoT Damage Scaling
- DoTs scale with the same stat as the ability's direct damage (Shadow Cut is STR, so its DoT also scales with STR)
- DoTs use reduced scaling rate compared to direct damage (account for multiple ticks - prevents double-dipping power)
- Power budget split approach: ability power is divided between direct damage and DoT
  - Example: Shadow Cut (power=4) might be 60% direct damage, 40% DoT total damage
  - Different abilities can use different splits (70/30 burst-heavy, 30/70 DoT-heavy)
  - Enables unique ability design across classes

### Debuff Magnitude Scaling
- Fixed magnitudes: debuffs have consistent power regardless of stats (predictable, tactical)
- Fixed durations: debuff duration does not scale with stats or ability power (consistent across all uses)
- Debuffs cost power budget: abilities with debuffs deal reduced damage proportionally
- All debuff types cost the same power budget: AC reduction, slow, damage amp - all cost flat % of power (simplifies balance)

### Duration vs Power Tradeoff
- Longer DoTs = same total damage, spread over more ticks
  - 3-tick DoT and 6-tick DoT with same power budget deal same total, just distributed differently
- Cast time bonus applies equally: long-cast DoT/debuff abilities get same power multiplier as direct damage
- Cooldown bonus applies equally: long-CD DoTs/debuffs get same power boost as direct damage
- Fixed tick rate: all DoTs tick every 3 seconds (predictable rhythm)

### AoE (Area of Effect) Balance
- AoE costs power budget: AoE abilities deal less damage per target than single-target (e.g., 60-70%)
- No target cap: AoE abilities hit unlimited enemies in range (balanced by reduced damage per target)
- Single tax: AoE abilities pay only the AoE cost - adding DoT/debuff to AoE doesn't further reduce power
- AoE buffs cost power budget: group buffs deal no damage or have reduced combat effectiveness

### HoT (Heal over Time) and Healing Balance
- HoTs mirror DoT rules: same stat scaling (WIS from Phase 3.1), reduced scaling rate, power budget split
- Direct heal + HoT power split: uses same power budget split approach as damage abilities
- HoTs tick at same rate as DoTs: every 3 seconds (unified rhythm for all periodic effects)
- AoE heals cost power budget: group heals heal for less per target, same as AoE damage cost

### Effect Stacking & Refresh
- Same ability refreshes duration: recasting the same DoT/HoT resets timer, doesn't stack damage
- Different abilities stack: Shadow Cut DoT + Plague Spark DoT both run simultaneously
- Same type stacks fully: multiple AC reduction debuffs stack additively (-5 AC + -3 AC = -8 AC)
- Different players stack: Player A's Shadow Cut + Player B's Shadow Cut = both DoTs run

### Claude's Discretion
- Exact power budget split percentages per ability (designer flexibility for unique abilities)
- AoE damage reduction percentage (60-70% range)
- Specific debuff magnitude values (balance through testing)
- DoT/HoT reduced scaling rate factor (balance total vs burst damage)

## Specific Ideas

**Power Budget Philosophy:**
- Abilities are built from power rating as a budget
- Direct damage, DoTs, HoTs, debuffs, buffs, and AoE all draw from this budget
- Creates natural tradeoffs: pure damage hits harder, utility abilities sacrifice damage for tactical advantage
- Enables class identity: DoT-heavy classes, burst classes, utility/support classes

**Consistency with Phase 3.1:**
- All scaling integrates with the hybrid formula: `(base + stat_scaling) * ability_multiplier / 100`
- Cast time and cooldown bonuses apply universally (risk/reward consistent)
- Stat scaling uses same patterns (STR/DEX/INT/WIS/CHA from ABILITY_STAT_SCALING mapping)

**Tick System:**
- 3-second tick rate for all periodic effects (DoTs, HoTs)
- Predictable, easy to understand
- Synchronized across all effects for combat rhythm

## Deferred Ideas

None — discussion stayed focused on DoT/HoT/debuff/buff balance within Phase 3.1.1 scope.
