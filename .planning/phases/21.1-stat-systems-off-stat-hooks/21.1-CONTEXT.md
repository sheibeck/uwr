# Phase 21.1 Context — Stat Systems & Off-Stat Hooks

> Captured from design conversation 2026-02-20

---

## Decisions (Locked)

### Block System
- Shield occupies the off-hand slot; block only triggers when a shield is equipped
- Classes that can equip shields: **warrior, paladin, cleric, spellblade, shaman**
- **DEX** drives **block chance** (% chance to block an incoming hit)
- **STR** drives **block mitigation** (% of damage absorbed when a block triggers)

### Stat Scaling Formula
- Linear, symmetric around **base 10**
- Above 10: bonus per point above 10
- Below 10: penalty per point below 10
- Same formula applied consistently across all stats / their respective systems

### Off-Stat Hooks
| Stat | Effect |
|------|--------|
| WIS  | % reduction to chance of pulling additional enemies (node perception mechanic unchanged) |
| INT  | % boost to recipe item drop chance on salvage |
| CHA  | % boost to vendor sell price + % discount on vendor buy price + % boost to faction gains + % boost to NPC affinity gains |
| STR  | Block mitigation % (new hook) |
| DEX  | Block chance % (new hook) |

### Recipe System Changes
- **Remove** auto-learn on salvage entirely
- Salvage now drops a **recipe item** (same item type as mob-dropped recipes) with INT-boosted chance
- Recipe items sit in inventory, are tradeable, and are learned via right-click (same flow as existing recipe items)

---

## Claude's Discretion (Implementation Details)

- Exact per-point scaling values (tuning subject to playtesting)
- How stat bonuses/penalties are applied in the damage/block pipeline (additive vs multiplicative)
- Where scaling helpers live in the codebase
- Server vs client responsibility split for block resolution

---

## Deferred / Out of Scope

- Shield visual art / 3D models
- Block animations or VFX
- Block-related affixes or crafting modifiers
- Any other stat hooks not listed above
