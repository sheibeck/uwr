<objective>
Human verification of the complete enemy combat balance system. Test all new mechanics: power scaling, DoT/debuff budget splits, healing, AoE, and buff abilities.

Purpose: Confirm the system works correctly in live gameplay before marking the phase complete. This is the only way to verify combat feels balanced and all ability types trigger properly.

Output: User approval or list of issues to address.

  <name>Task 1: Verify enemy combat balance system end-to-end</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
Present the test scenarios to the user and wait for approval.

What was built:
1. Enemy abilities now scale with enemy level (ENEMY_BASE_POWER 10 + level * 5)
2. Enemy DoT abilities split power between direct damage and periodic ticks (50/50 default)
3. Enemy debuff abilities deal reduced direct damage (25% power cost for debuff)
4. Enemy healer types (Fen Witch, Grave Acolyte) can heal lowest-HP ally with direct heal + HoT
5. Enemy AoE types (Cinder Sentinel, Basalt Brute) hit all players at 65% damage per target (direct damage only, no DoTs)
6. Enemy buffer types (Hexbinder, Sootbound Mystic) buff all living enemy allies
7. Physical abilities mitigated by armor; magic abilities bypass armor

How to verify:

**Test 1: Enemy DoT Power Scaling**
1. Fight an enemy with a DoT ability (e.g., Bog Rat with Poison Bite, or Ash Jackal with Scorching Snap)
2. Observe the combat log — the enemy should deal direct damage AND apply a DoT
3. The direct damage should be noticeable (not zero), and the DoT should tick for visible amounts
4. Compare to before: previously DoTs were fixed magnitude (1-4 per tick) regardless of level. Now they scale.
5. Expected: Level 1 enemy total power = 15 + abilityPower*5. Poison Bite (power 3n): total = 15+15=30. Direct = 15, DoT total = 15 over 3 ticks = 5/tick.

**Test 2: Enemy Debuff with Reduced Direct Damage**
1. Fight an enemy with a debuff ability (e.g., Grave Acolyte with Sapping Chant)
2. Observe the combat log — the enemy should deal direct damage AND apply the debuff
3. The direct damage should be lower than a pure damage ability (25% power cost for debuff)
4. Check your character panel — the debuff effect should appear

**Test 3: Enemy Healer (Fen Witch or Grave Acolyte)**
1. Find and engage Fen Witch (has both mire_curse and shaman_heal) or Grave Acolyte (sapping_chant + dark_mend)
2. Observe the combat log — the healer should periodically heal its lowest-HP ally
3. The heal amount should be visible in the log (e.g., "Fen Witch heals [ally] for X")
4. If fighting multiple enemies, damage one significantly and watch if the healer targets it

**Test 4: Enemy AoE (Cinder Sentinel or Basalt Brute)**
1. Group up with another character (or have a group member)
2. Engage Cinder Sentinel (has ember_slam + flame_burst) or Basalt Brute (quake_stomp + quake_wave)
3. Observe the combat log when the AoE fires — ALL group members should take damage simultaneously
4. Damage should be 65% of what single-target would be
5. Confirm NO DoT is applied from the AoE ability

**Test 5: Enemy Buffer (Hexbinder or Sootbound Mystic)**
1. Engage Hexbinder (withering_hex + warchief_rally) or Sootbound Mystic (soot_hex + bolster_defenses)
2. Observe the combat log — "X rallies allies with Warchief Rally!" or similar
3. After the buff, enemy allies should deal more damage (if damage_bonus) or take less damage (if armor_up)

**Test 6: Damage Type Routing**
1. Fight a physical enemy (Bog Rat, Thicket Wolf) — armor should reduce their ability damage
2. Fight a magic enemy (Ember Wisp, Frostbone Acolyte) — armor should NOT reduce their ability damage
3. If you have magic resist gear/buffs, magic damage should be reduced by resist instead
