# Phase 03.1.2: Combat Balance for Enemies - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-13
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Extend the combat balance system established in Phases 3.1 and 3.1.1 to enemy abilities. Enemies need their own power scaling, DoT/debuff mechanics, healing/support capabilities, and multi-target abilities that mirror the player combat system for consistency.

Phase 3.1 established player stat scaling and crits. Phase 3.1.1 established DoT/HoT/debuff/AoE power budget splits for players. Phase 03.1.2 applies these same systems to enemies with specific tuning decisions.

## Implementation Decisions

### Enemy Power Scaling
- Enemy ability damage scales by **enemy level only** (fixed formulas, not scaling with player stats or group size)
- Enemies use the **same power budget system** as players (power rating split between direct damage and DoT/debuff)
- Enemies do **NOT** have stats (no STR/DEX/INT/WIS affecting their abilities) — damage is purely level + power rating
- **No group size scaling** — enemy damage is the same whether fighting 1 player or 5 players

### Enemy DoT/Debuff Mechanics
- Enemies **can apply DoTs** (damage over time) to players
- Enemies **can apply all debuff types** (armor reduction, slow, damage amp, etc.)
- Enemy DoTs/debuffs follow the **same rules as player effects**:
  - 3-second tick rate (same tick_hot scheduled reducer)
  - Same stacking/refresh logic (same ability refreshes, different abilities stack)
  - Same effect tracking via CharacterEffect table
- Enemy abilities with DoTs/debuffs **use power budget split** (reduced direct damage, just like player abilities)

### Enemy Healing and Support
- **Enemy healers exist** — some enemy types (shamans, clerics) can heal allies
- Enemy healing uses the **same power budget split** as player healing (direct heal + HoT)
- **Enemy buffs exist** — some enemies can buff allies (damage up, armor up, etc.)
- Enemy buffs **cost power budget** like player buffs (buffs reduce direct damage)

### Multi-Target Enemy Abilities
- **Enemy AoE abilities exist** — some enemies can hit multiple players with one ability
- Enemy AoE uses **65% damage per target** (same AOE_DAMAGE_MULTIPLIER as player AoE)
- **No target cap** — enemy AoE hits all players in the group (consistent with player AoE)
- **Enemy AoE cannot apply DoTs** — AoE abilities deal direct damage only, no periodic effects (different from players, prevents overwhelming group pressure)

### Claude's Discretion
- Specific enemy ability design (which enemies get DoTs, heals, AoE, etc.)
- Exact power budget split percentages per enemy ability
- Enemy ability variety and combat patterns per enemy type
- How many abilities each enemy type has

## Specific Ideas

**Consistency with Phase 3.1.1:**
- Enemies use the same combat systems as players for balance parity
- Power budget approach creates natural tradeoffs (DoT-heavy enemies deal less direct damage)
- Effect stacking/refresh logic is unified across players and enemies
- Tick rate (3 seconds) is consistent for all periodic effects

**Key Difference from Players:**
- Enemy AoE abilities cannot apply DoTs (direct damage only) to prevent overwhelming multi-target pressure on groups
- Enemies don't have stats affecting abilities (simpler design, level-based scaling only)

## Deferred Ideas

None — discussion stayed focused on extending Phase 3.1/3.1.1 combat balance to enemies.
