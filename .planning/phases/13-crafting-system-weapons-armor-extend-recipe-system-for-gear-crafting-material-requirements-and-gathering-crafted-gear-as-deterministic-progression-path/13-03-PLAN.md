<objective>
Extend the CraftingPanel UI with type filter chips, show-only-craftable toggle, red/green material requirement display, and remove the Research Recipes button. Update the salvage confirmation dialog text in InventoryPanel.

Purpose: Frontend user experience for the crafting system — players can browse recipes by type, see material requirements with availability indicators, and craft gear.
Output: Updated CraftingPanel.vue, useCrafting.ts composable, and InventoryPanel.vue.

  <name>Task 1: Extend useCrafting composable with recipeType filtering and craftable toggle</name>
  <files>
    src/composables/useCrafting.ts
  </files>
  <action>
Read the existing `useCrafting.ts` composable to understand its current structure. Extend it with:

1. **Add new reactive state:**
   ```typescript
   const activeFilter = ref<string>('All');
   const showOnlyCraftable = ref(false);
   ```

2. **Add recipeType to recipe mapping.** The existing `recipes` computed likely maps `recipeTemplates` rows. After Plan 01, RecipeTemplate rows now have a `recipeType` field. Extend each recipe object in the computed with:
   - `recipeType`: from the RecipeTemplate row's `recipeType` field (default to 'consumable' if undefined for backward compat)
   - `materialType`: from the RecipeTemplate row's `materialType` field (may be undefined)

3. **Add material availability check per requirement.** For each recipe's requirements (req1, req2, req3), compute whether the player has enough of that material. The existing composable likely already does this for the `canCraft` flag. Extend each requirement with a `hasMaterial: boolean` field:
   ```typescript
   requirements: [
     { templateId: recipe.req1TemplateId, name: req1Template?.name, count: recipe.req1Count, owned: ownedCount, hasMaterial: ownedCount >= recipe.req1Count },
     // ... req2, req3 if present
   ]
   ```

4. **Compute available filter types.** Derive the set of unique recipeTypes from known recipes:
   ```typescript
   const recipeTypes = computed(() => {
     const types = new Set(recipes.value.map(r => r.recipeType));
     return ['All', ...Array.from(types).sort()];
   });
   ```

5. **Apply filters to the recipe list.** Create a `filteredRecipes` computed that chains:
   - Filter by `activeFilter` (if not 'All', match recipeType)
   - Filter by `showOnlyCraftable` (if true, only show recipes where canCraft is true)
   ```typescript
   const filteredRecipes = computed(() => {
     return recipes.value
       .filter(r => activeFilter.value === 'All' || r.recipeType === activeFilter.value)
       .filter(r => !showOnlyCraftable.value || r.canCraft);
   });
   ```

6. **Return new properties** from the composable: `activeFilter`, `showOnlyCraftable`, `filteredRecipes`, `recipeTypes`.

7. **Keep existing functionality intact.** Do not remove or change the `craftRecipe` action, the `selectedRecipe` ref, or any existing reactive state. The existing `canCraft` logic should continue working.

**NOTE on `recipeType` field access:** After bindings are regenerated (Plan 01 adds columns to RecipeTemplate), the generated type will include `recipeType` and `materialType`. Until bindings are regenerated, these fields may need `(recipe as any).recipeType` casting. Use the casting approach if the field isn't in the generated type yet — Plan 01's publish+generate step will fix this.

  <name>Task 2: Update CraftingPanel UI with filter chips, toggle, and material display; update InventoryPanel salvage text</name>

**Part A: Update CraftingPanel.vue**

Read the existing CraftingPanel.vue to understand its layout and styling. Make these changes:

1. **Remove the "Research Recipes" button.** Find the button/section that calls `researchRecipes` or `onResearchRecipes` and remove it entirely. The research_recipes mechanic is replaced by salvage-to-recipe discovery.

2. **Add type filter chips** at the top of the recipe list area. Use a horizontal row of small buttons/chips:
   ```vue
   <div style="display: flex; gap: 4px; margin-bottom: 8px; flex-wrap: wrap;">
     <button
       v-for="type in recipeTypes"
       :key="type"
       @click="activeFilter = type"
       :style="{
         padding: '2px 8px',
         fontSize: '11px',
         border: '1px solid #555',
         borderRadius: '3px',
         background: activeFilter === type ? '#4a6' : '#333',
         color: activeFilter === type ? '#fff' : '#aaa',
         cursor: 'pointer',
       }"
     >
       {{ type }}
     </button>
   </div>
   ```
   Use `recipeTypes` and `activeFilter` from the composable.

3. **Add show-only-craftable toggle** below the filter chips:
   ```vue
   <label style="display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 4px; fontSize: '11px'; color: '#aaa'; margin-bottom: 6px;">
     <input type="checkbox" v-model="showOnlyCraftable" />
     Show only craftable
   </label>
   ```

4. **Update recipe list to use `filteredRecipes`** instead of the previous unfiltered list. Replace the `v-for` source with `filteredRecipes`.

5. **Show material requirements with red/green coloring.** In each recipe's detail/expanded area, display the material requirements:
   ```vue
   <div v-for="req in recipe.requirements" :key="req.templateId?.toString()">
     <span :style="{ color: req.hasMaterial ? '#4a6' : '#c44' }">
       {{ req.name }}: {{ req.owned }}/{{ req.count }}
     </span>
   </div>
   ```
   - Green (#4a6) when the player has enough
   - Red (#c44) when the player is short

6. **Ensure Craft button disabled state.** The existing Craft button likely has a disabled condition. Ensure it checks `!recipe.canCraft`. If the recipe requires materials the player doesn't have, the button should be disabled and visually dimmed (opacity: 0.5 or similar).

7. **Style consistency.** Use the existing panel styling patterns from the codebase (dark backgrounds #1a1a2e/#2a2a3e, light text #ccc/#aaa, green accents #4a6). Match the existing CraftingPanel's aesthetic.

**Part B: Update InventoryPanel.vue salvage confirmation text**

Find the salvage confirmation dialog/text in InventoryPanel.vue (per research, around line 236). Change the text from referencing gold to referencing crafting materials:

Old: `"Salvage ${item.name}? You will receive gold. This cannot be undone."`
New: `"Salvage ${item.name}? You will receive crafting materials. This cannot be undone."`

If the exact text differs from the research, find the salvage confirm string and update it to mention "crafting materials" instead of "gold".

- CraftingPanel.vue has type filter chips, craftable toggle, and red/green material display
- Research Recipes button removed from CraftingPanel
- InventoryPanel salvage text updated
- useCrafting.ts exports new filter state and filtered recipe list
- No backend changes (those are Plan 01 and 02)
- Styling consistent with existing dark theme

<success_criteria>
The crafting UI is complete: players can filter recipes by type, toggle to show only craftable recipes, see material requirements with availability coloring, and craft items. The salvage confirmation text reflects the new material yield. Combined with Plans 01 and 02, the full crafting system is functional end-to-end.
