<objective>
Build the client-side hunger UI: HungerBar component showing current hunger level and Well Fed status, Eat button for food items in inventory, and all wiring through App.vue to the eat_food reducer.

Purpose: Players need to see their hunger state and be able to eat food items to gain the Well Fed buff. This completes the hunger feature end-to-end.
Output: Working HungerBar component, Eat button on food items, full eat_food flow wired.

  <name>Task 1: HungerBar component and data subscription</name>
  <files>
    src/components/HungerBar.vue
    src/composables/useGameData.ts
    src/composables/useInventory.ts
  </files>
  <action>
**A. Add myHunger subscription to `src/composables/useGameData.ts`:**

After the existing `useTable` calls (line ~57, after `const [races] = useTable(tables.race);`), add:

```typescript
const [myHunger] = useTable(tables.myHunger);
```

Add `myHunger` to the return object.

**B. Add `eatable` property to inventory items in `src/composables/useInventory.ts`:**

In the `InventoryItem` type (near line 35-44), add:
```typescript
eatable: boolean;
```

In the `inventoryItems` computed (near line 98+), after the `usable` computation (line 140-141), add:
```typescript
const eatable = (template?.slot ?? '').toLowerCase() === 'food';
```

Include `eatable` in the returned item object (near line 142-159).

Return `eatable` alongside existing properties from the composable if needed (check if `InventoryItem` type is used elsewhere — it should just be the interface).

**C. Create `src/components/HungerBar.vue`:**

Vue 3 SFC with `<script setup lang="ts">`. Props:
- `hunger`: `{ currentHunger: bigint; wellFedUntil: { microsSinceUnixEpoch: bigint }; wellFedDamageBonusPercent: bigint } | null`
- `styles`: `any` (the global styles object)

Computed properties:
- `hungerPercent`: `Number(props.hunger?.currentHunger ?? 0n)` — value 0-100
- `wellFedUntilDate`: Convert timestamp per CLAUDE.md — `new Date(Number(props.hunger.wellFedUntil.microsSinceUnixEpoch / 1000n))`
- `isWellFed`: `wellFedUntilDate > new Date()`
- `timeRemainingMinutes`: `Math.max(0, Math.floor((wellFedUntilDate.getTime() - Date.now()) / 60000))`
- `damageBonusPercent`: `Number(props.hunger?.wellFedDamageBonusPercent ?? 0n)`

Template structure (follow existing component styles pattern from StatsPanel.vue — inline styles via `:style="styles.xxx"`):
- Hunger label: "Hunger: {hungerPercent}/100"
- Progress bar: A div with background color, width set to `hungerPercent`%. Use green for >50, yellow for 20-50, red for <20. No penalty text at 0 (REQ-015).
- Well Fed section (v-if="isWellFed"):
  - "Well Fed" badge with green indicator
  - "+{damageBonusPercent}% damage"
  - "{timeRemainingMinutes}m remaining"

Style the progress bar using inline styles consistent with the codebase pattern (styles.ts objects). The bar should be compact — this goes in the side panel area. Use `styles.panel` or `styles.statRow` patterns from existing components.

Keep it simple. This is a display-only component — no user interaction.

TypeScript compilation check: `npx vue-tsc --noEmit` (or run `npm run build` if available). Verify HungerBar.vue compiles, useGameData.ts exports myHunger, useInventory.ts includes eatable property on items.
  </verify>
  <done>
HungerBar.vue created with hunger bar, Well Fed badge (damage bonus + time remaining), and no-penalty display at 0. useGameData.ts subscribes to myHunger. useInventory.ts marks food items as eatable.

  <name>Task 2: App.vue wiring — HungerBar rendering and Eat button</name>
  <files>
    src/App.vue
    src/components/InventoryPanel.vue
    src/ui/styles.ts
  </files>
  <action>
**A. Import HungerBar in `src/App.vue`:**

Add import near other panel imports (line 547-563):
```typescript
import HungerBar from './components/HungerBar.vue';
```

**B. Extract myHunger from useGameData:**

In App.vue where `useGameData()` is destructured (search for `const { conn, players, myPlayer`), add `myHunger` to the destructured properties.

**C. Compute active hunger row:**

Add a computed property near other character-derived computeds:
```typescript
const activeHunger = computed(() => {
  if (!selectedCharacter.value || !myHunger.value.length) return null;
  return myHunger.value.find(
    (h: any) => h.characterId.toString() === selectedCharacter.value?.id.toString()
  ) ?? null;
});
```

**D. Render HungerBar in template:**

Place HungerBar in the StatsPanel area (line 212-219). After `</StatsPanel>`, add HungerBar as a companion display that shows when the stats panel is active OR as a persistent element when a character is selected. The simplest placement: render it right after the StatsPanel block, visible when `activePanel === 'stats'` and selectedCharacter exists:

```vue
<HungerBar
  v-if="activePanel === 'stats' && selectedCharacter"
  :hunger="activeHunger"
  :styles="styles"
/>
```

Alternatively, if the game has a persistent status area (check template structure), place it there. Follow existing UI patterns.

**E. Add Eat button to `src/components/InventoryPanel.vue`:**

Near the existing "Use" button (line 68-73), add an "Eat" button for food items:

```vue
<button
  v-if="item.eatable"
  :style="styles.primaryButton"
  @click="$emit('eat-food', item.id)"
>
  Eat
</button>
```

Add `'eat-food'` to the component's `defineEmits`. Check existing emits declaration and add the new event.

**F. Wire eat-food event in App.vue:**

1. Add `@eat-food="eatFood"` to the `<InventoryPanel>` element (line 145-162).
2. Create the eatFood reducer reference:
```typescript
const eatFoodReducer = useReducer(reducers.eatFood);
```
3. Create the handler:
```typescript
const eatFood = (itemInstanceId: bigint) => {
  if (!conn.isActive || !selectedCharacter.value) return;
  eatFoodReducer({ characterId: selectedCharacter.value.id, itemInstanceId });
};
```

**G. Add hunger-related styles to `src/ui/styles.ts` if needed:**

Add styles for the hunger bar (progress bar container, fill, Well Fed badge). Follow the existing inline style pattern. Example additions to the styles object:

```typescript
hungerBar: {
  width: '100%',
  height: '14px',
  backgroundColor: '#333',
  borderRadius: '4px',
  overflow: 'hidden',
  marginTop: '4px',
},
hungerFill: {
  height: '100%',
  borderRadius: '4px',
  transition: 'width 0.3s ease',
},
wellFedBadge: {
  display: 'inline-block',
  padding: '2px 8px',
  borderRadius: '4px',
  backgroundColor: '#2a5a2a',
  color: '#7fdf7f',
  fontSize: '11px',
  marginTop: '4px',
},
```
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `npm run dev` (or the project's dev server command). Open the app in browser. Create a character — verify hunger bar appears on stats panel showing 100/100. Buy Trail Rations from vendor. Open inventory — verify "Eat" button appears on Trail Rations. Click Eat — verify food consumed and Well Fed status appears on hunger bar with "+5% damage" and "30m remaining" (approximately). Wait and verify hunger decays (check after 5+ minutes).
  </verify>
  <done>
HungerBar renders on stats panel showing hunger level and Well Fed status. Food items show Eat button in inventory. Clicking Eat calls eat_food reducer, consumes item, and Well Fed badge appears with damage bonus and time remaining. Hunger bar shows no penalty at 0.
  </done>

  <name>Task 3: Human verification of hunger system end-to-end</name>
  <files>n/a</files>
  <action>
Human verifies the complete hunger system works end-to-end. Everything was built in Plan 01 (backend) and Tasks 1-2 (frontend) — this checkpoint confirms it works visually and functionally.

Steps to verify:
1. Open the application in browser
2. Create a new character
3. Navigate to Stats panel — verify hunger bar shows "100/100" (or similar full display)
4. Verify NO Well Fed badge is shown initially
5. Go to vendor and buy Trail Rations
6. Open inventory — verify Trail Rations has an "Eat" button (not just "Use")
7. Click "Eat" on Trail Rations — verify:
   a. Trail Rations consumed (quantity decremented or removed)
   b. Well Fed badge appears on hunger bar showing "+5% damage" and ~30 minutes remaining
8. Enter combat with an enemy
9. Verify damage dealt appears to include the Well Fed bonus (compare with expected base damage)
10. Wait 5+ minutes — verify hunger has decayed by ~2 points (98/100 or similar)
11. Verify hunger bar at 0 shows no penalty text or negative indicator (REQ-015)

Expected behavior:
- Hunger starts at 100, decays 2 per 5 minutes
- Eating food shows Well Fed with correct duration and damage bonus
- Combat damage includes Well Fed percentage bonus on both auto-attacks and abilities
- No penalty at hunger 0

Type "approved" to confirm hunger system works correctly, or describe any issues found.
