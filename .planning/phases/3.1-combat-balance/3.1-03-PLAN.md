<objective>
Human verification of the complete combat balance system. Test stat scaling, critical strikes, ability damage, healing, and damage type routing in live gameplay.

Purpose: Confirm that the mathematical formulas produce fun, balanced combat where stats matter but gear remains dominant.

Output: Verification approval or issues for gap closure.

  <name>Task 1: Verify combat balance in live gameplay</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
Present the following to the user for verification. This is a human-verify checkpoint — no automated work to do.

What was built (Plans 01 and 02):
- STR scales auto-attack damage (~1.5% per point, multiplicative)
- DEX provides critical strike chance (0.1% per point, capped at 50%) with weapon-type crit multipliers (fast=1.5x, medium=2.0x, slow=2.5x)
- Ability damage uses hybrid formula: (base + stat_scaling) * ability_multiplier
- Cast time compensation: longer cast = higher ability multiplier
- WIS scales healing power for healing classes (2% per point)
- Magic damage bypasses armor (impactful against armored targets)
- Physical damage uses tuned armor curve (~33% at 50 armor, ~50% at 100)
- Critical hit messages in combat log

Steps for user to verify:
1. Open the game in browser (the default Vite dev server URL or the published maincloud URL)
2. Create or use a Warrior character — enter combat, observe auto-attack damage numbers (should see STR contribution)
3. Create or use a Rogue character — enter combat, watch for "Critical hit!" messages in the combat log
4. Create or use a Wizard character — cast Magic Missile or Frost Shard (damage should scale with INT)
5. Create or use a Cleric character — cast Mend or Heal (healing should reflect WIS contribution)
6. Compare Wizard spells vs Warrior auto-attacks — both should feel viable, wizard spells bypass armor
7. Check combat log messages for proper formatting (no broken messages, crit messages display correctly)
8. Verify no crashes or errors (check browser console and `spacetime logs uwr`)

Key balance checks:
- Stats should feel impactful but gear should still be the primary power source
- High-STR warrior should deal ~15-30% more damage than same warrior with base STR
- Critical strikes should be occasional (not every hit), with big damage on slow weapon crits
- Healing classes should noticeably out-heal non-healing classes

Resume signal: Type "approved" if combat balance feels good, or describe specific issues.
