# Phase 3.1: Combat Balance - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-12
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Balance combat between melee and caster classes by addressing damage scaling, stat contribution, and class viability. This phase works within the existing class and ability framework (5 abilities per class, levels 1-5). New abilities, classes, or major system changes are separate phases.

**Current state:** Level 1 abilities are balanced, level 2 partially balanced. Odd levels = combat abilities, even levels = utility/combat-adjacent.

## Implementation Decisions

### Stat Scaling Formula

**Auto-attack damage:**
- STR (Strength) scales weapon-based auto-attack damage
- Scaling magnitude: 1-2% damage increase per STR point (moderate scaling)
- Gear remains dominant power source, stats are secondary

**Critical strikes:**
- DEX (Dexterity) influences critical strike chance
- Linear scaling: 0.1-0.2% crit chance per DEX point
- Critical damage multiplier: **Variable by weapon type**
  - Fast weapons: lower multiplier (e.g., 1.5x)
  - Slow weapons: higher multiplier (e.g., 2.5x)
  - Rewards weapon choice and build planning

**Ability scaling (per-class):**
- Melee weapon abilities: scale from STR
- Caster spells: scale from INT (Intelligence)
- Hybrid classes: abilities can scale from multiple stats
- Specific abilities may use different stats (ability-by-ability basis)

### Class Role Philosophy

**DPS balance:**
- Role-based DPS tiers: Pure DPS > Hybrids > Tanks/Healers
- Specialization = power (traditional MMO model)

**Defensive balance:**
- Defense comes from gear choices, not class (independent scaling)
- A warrior can build glass cannon or tank based on gear selection
- Armor proficiencies remain: Warriors = plate, Mages = cloth, etc.
- Stats and enchants on gear determine actual tankiness, not just armor type

**Role-defining mechanics:**
- Tanks get taunt and threat management mechanics
- Healers get group healing capabilities
- Classes have unique mechanics that define their role beyond just stat differences

### Ability Power vs Auto-Attacks

**Ability damage scaling:**
- Hybrid formula: `(base_damage + stat * scaling) * ability_multiplier`
- Example: Fireball = `(base + INT * 2) * 1.5`
- Both stat scaling AND ability multiplier contribute

**Cast time compensation:**
- Longer cast time = higher ability multiplier
- 2-second Fireball hits harder than instant Shock
- DPS equalizes over time when accounting for cast time

**Resource costs:**
- Higher power = higher mana cost (efficiency constant)
- Fireball (150 mana, 300 dmg) has same damage-per-mana as Shock (50 mana, 100 dmg)
- Choice is tactical (burst vs sustained) not economic

**Cooldown design:**
- Longer cooldown = higher burst damage
- 30-second cooldown abilities hit much harder than 6-second abilities
- Rewards cooldown management and planning

### Defensive Balance Approach

**Caster survivability:**
- Cloth-wearing casters get shields, barriers, or damage absorption abilities
- Different defensive paradigm from armor (temporary protection vs constant mitigation)
- Provides survival parity without making armor irrelevant

**Wisdom (WIS) stat:**
- Increases healing power for healing classes
- Increases mana pool for healers and classes with WIS as primary or hybrid stat
- Does NOT directly increase magic resistance

**Armor mechanics:**
- Diminishing returns curve for damage reduction
- First 50 armor = ~30% reduction, next 50 armor = ~15% more
- Prevents extreme tank stacking

**Magic resistance:**
- Rarer than armor but more powerful per point
- Makes magic damage impactful
- Less available on gear, forces tactical choices

## Specific Ideas

None beyond the detailed mechanics above — implementation is open to standard RPG combat formulas that match the scaling philosophies defined.

## Deferred Ideas

None — discussion stayed within phase scope (balancing existing combat mechanics).
