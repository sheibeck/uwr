Quick task 319 initialized. Directory created. Planner not yet spawned.

<what_to_do>
1. Spawn planner for quick-319: "Fix Discordant Note to use 65% AoE damage scaling"
2. The user reports Discordant Note (a Bard AoE ability) is hitting too hard — it should apply the 65% AoE damage multiplier per target (see STATE.md decision #38: "AoE abilities deal 65% damage per target")
3. Look in spacetimedb/src/data/ for the Discordant Note ability definition (likely in ability data or class ability definitions)
4. Look in spacetimedb/src/reducers/combat.ts for how AoE damage is applied — verify the 65% multiplier (AOE_DAMAGE_MULTIPLIER or similar) is being applied to Discordant Note
5. The fix is likely either: the ability data doesn't flag it as AoE, or the combat resolver isn't applying the 65% scaling to it
6. After fix: publish locally, regen bindings
